  "body": "**Bael is a free template that gives you an easy way to start a blog that uses modern technologies like static-site JAMstack architecture, CSS grid layout, responsive design, a serverless function that handles emails newsletter signup with Sendgrid, and fuzzy search â€” all wrapped up in a brutalist aesthetic.**\n\nBael runs using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org), and is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Bael requires an account with Netlify and Github/Gitlab to deploy. A free Sendgrid account and API key is needed to setup the email newsletter signup.\n\nMade by [jake101](https://jake101.com)"
